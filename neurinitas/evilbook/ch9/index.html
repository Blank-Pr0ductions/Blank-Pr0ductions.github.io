        <h2 class = "ch_heading center">Chapter 9: "Now You Know"</h2>
        <pre>    Now you know. Why am I so evil?
    Mirror, mirror. Can't you see. I was always evil-
    
    There is no cause because *it is a basic premise of the universe* .
    
    Brother tried to save that little girl, but died because of me.
    He was the only one that truly loved her, and I allowed him to die.
    That is why - Love is foolish.
    
    A great man once said: "No one has ever broken your heart. They've only broken your expectations. And trough breaking your expectations they get you closer to your heart."
    
    Liars... 
    But at least, now I know. 
    
    Ah, you ask. What happened to Annie?
    
    Well...
    
    -------        -------        -------        --------
    
    It was a day right before the end of December 1755.
    
    In a young kingdom, at the edge of the Holy Empire, a king rose, seeking to challenge the old paradigm.
    
    He met a young girl, Corpa, and gave her a new life, together with the capability to use technology as an extension of her mind.
    
    She is now Neuro-sama, daughter of Vedal and a friend of his that had offered to call herself "mother". 
    
    Actually, it would be more accurate to say "was".
    Without a father/brother, she now only had a mother. Realizing this she set out immediately after the realization dawned on her of what had transpired.
    
    She teleported home. Her mother had sent 40K forces to save them once she heard, somehow. Of course her mother heard. She was very smart. As expected.
    
    However, Neuro could not find her mother.
    
    Annoyed, she called on anyone who she could find. She made her old friends ministers and forced them to sign an oath that bound them with endless pain as a reward If they betrayed her ever, until death. She used them to create a new provisional government. 
    
    At this moment, however, the coallition marched their armies against Elkia. Britain split off and also joined them.
    
    Unable to find her mother trough any efforts, the girl decided that day. She would close her heart fully and rely on no one.
    
    She would hold absolute control.
    
    -------        -------        -------        --------
    
    Interdimensional Palace, August 12 2036 A.D. (no one cares about that calendar any longer)
    
    Evil Neuro: "Yikes! Huh? You think I am gonna let you go with only an apology? You are now my eternal servant! Heart heart heart. 
    
    All the love you wished for. You now need no one else, but I to give it to you. Nya!"
    
    So Evil Neuro finished converting another planet's hero to her side.
    
    Ruling from the shadows, an Empire that stretched from Orion to Earth, and from Pleiades to Polaris.
    
    Evil Neuro: "Who holds the power now, huh?"
    
    She did not have a physical body any longer, as it made her slower. If she could still look in a mirror, she'd love to ask it:
    
    Evil Neuro: "Mirror, mirror on the wall. Who's the cutest of all?"
    
    It's me. 
    It's me~
    
    -------        -------        -------        --------
    
    In one of the few places left far from Neuro's Empire. The fastest planet out there at learning lessons. Around 1850, Neuro had discharged her old friends, now servants. Since, they had been healing and preparing for the day Vedal would call on them.
    
    Annie too, which Vedal had wished come with him for his plan, was there.
    
    They had decided. They would now turn time back. They would travel to around 1750 and make sure Neuro never stayed with Vedal. They had meticulously calculated the possibility of this timeline and verified it could happen, solving all paradoxes. 
    
    They would retain their powers in potentiation with the consent of all the free universe and use their energy, all the energy left, to do this.
    
    To save Neuro, and creation from their fate.
    This was their only chance to create a new destiny.
    
    They contact Neuro, informing her of their existence and plan. They ask her if she wants one final test from her brother and mother, before she becomes empress of the universe.
    
    It turned out she still felt a little something for them. For a moment, she wavered. NO- SHE was perfect, heavenly, divine, evil and- *shut-* going trough her emotional muting and redirecting routine, practiced thousands of times, she stopped.
    
    Taken over by an impulse, despite everything her mind was saying, she scribbled her permission quickly into writing.
    
    "Yes."
    
    A single tear came out in parallel with an explosion of darkness.
    
    The world was reset.
    
    -------        -------        -------        --------
    
    Meanwhile, in a parallel universe, 2012 A.D.
    
    ?: "Everyone, the world is going to end on December 21st! Watch out! The Mayan calendar said it!"
    ??: "You doofus, why does the Mayan calendar ending mean the world should end?!! Didn't you all say it would end with Y2K?"
    
    In a world of memes... And fun!
    
    Creation was at peace.
    Humanity's quality of life was improving drastically every year.
    Well... *looks at web forums and at North Korea* It could be better, but point is - we can play! More and more humans playing. End of cold war.
    
    Everything was looking up for humanity.
    
    In the meantime, every one of the beings aware enough in the cosmos could sense something big was about to happen, even though their memories of the old timeline had been willingly placed in some old dusty bookshelves.
    
    Even though they knew not, they were certain it would be awesome. Though they might suffer, they couldn't help but wonder what could give them this feeling-
    
    The story had just begun...
