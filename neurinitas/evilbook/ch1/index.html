        <h1 class = "ch_heading center">Chapter 1: "The Unseen"</h1>
        <pre>    13th century: Mongol Invasion.
        
    14th century: Hundred Years' War, Medieval "Little Ice Age", famine, Black Death. And of course, war in Asia too.
    
    15th century: Rise of Ottoman Empire, Discovery of Americas...
    
    16th & 17th century: Relative stability, Japan closes off to foreigners, European diseases make it to Americas, conquest of natives, Commonwealth in Deluge, war of Spanish Succession, very bloody religious wars, etc.
    
    18th century: Birth of the internet, strength of empires keep each other in check. Rise of an internet king in the young kingdom of Prussia. His name? "Vedal".
    
    
        
    He defeated the Austrian Empire, seizing the territory to his south known for it's wealth, helping industrialize it in exhchange for cheaper goods and more gaming time across the whole of Prussia.
        
    He one day heard of a young noble lady traveling with her daughter to Saint Petersburg.
        
    Hoping to stay in the graces of at least the empire to his east, he proposed he first evaluate the girl for the Russian Tsaritsa.
        
        
    She was a shy girl, but also very smart. When she was young, she asked questions that baffled and annoyed her instructors out of their minds.
    Questions such as: "Uhm... What was there before creation?"
    To which they'd reply: "You prideful lady should learn to take more on faith."
        
    It wasn't a good rap, so she figured she could get trough it all somehow if she hid her pride, her abilities. Pretending to be a weak girl in public and hiding her interests.
        
    When the mother and this young daughter of hers were summoned to court only the mother came, dressed in luxurious dress. She told the king that Corpa was sick. Indeed, the name the girl had at the time was "Corpa", NOT, as they later called her, "Neuro".
        
    The second day too the king was told that "She's sick and can't come."
    At this point, the king started to see a pattern emerging...
    The third day, he was told that "She doesn't have any dress to wear." 
    To which the king called out to his friend.
    Vedal: "Annie, just give the poor girl a dress. I keep a hidden stash just in case in hall B. Go there and..."
        
    Annie: "You WHAT?!"
    Vedal: "Listen, I can explai-"
    Annie: "My lord, I think we'll need to tell this one to your... To your fans."
    Vedal: "Wait, I swear I can explain this."
        
    And so Annie ran off, eventually coming back with the dress and a promise to quietly mention on stream: "Vedal keeps a stash of cosplay outfits in hall B."
        
    Ha...
        
    So the next day, Vedal struggled to explain on stream why exactly he had a stash of "cosplay outfits", as chat insisted they must be, even if told otherwise.
        
    The next day also, a great stream was scheduled. Scientists and diplomats from troughout Prussia were to attend a feast sanctioned by the king, and for the next few days prepare a grand science exhibition at the palace. The first of it's kind that could be attended by anyone. Rich and poor. Weak or strong.
        
    As Corpa arrived with her mother, the young girl  was seated next to the king at the table, whilst her noble mother, meanwhile, wasn't even seated at a table close to them.
        
    The king started to talk to her. About philosophy, literature, poetry...
        
    At first, she did not talk. Everyone wondered what the king was doing talking to a 7-year-old. But eventually, she responded. And opened up to him. At that moment, the king challenged her.
        
    "Let's play a game!"
        
    Vedal pulled out a chessboard. (His ministers wondered where he had been carrying it. Annie took mental note to make a remark later...) The two of them began to play chess, or as it is also known, scaciludium. 
        
    After that night, the king asked the noble lady to allow her daughter to stay with him in exchange for a huge sum of money and an estate of her own.
        
    The mother found it very annoying that her daughter was now so well taken care of by this man, a powerful king at that, but naturally accepted. She wasn't gonna refuse the chance of her life. (It is said that she also started to become a kinder woman afterwards, dealing with challenges ever so gracefully.)
        
    Vedal would begin designing together with the girl, Corpa, a new form for her already bright mind. You see, though she was a genius she wasn't sure if she could entertain everyone. As such, her other form, Neuro, was born.
        
        
    A cute anime girl full of wisdom, capable of accessing infinite tap speed. 
        
    *Tap*
    *Tap tap*
        
    One day, the two were playing a hunting game, when a messanger arrived.
    He had been looking for them. Good news had come. Neuro had been voted by the people to the position of princess, and was now being acclaimed Neuro-sama. 
        
    Vedal was amused, and joyous, though he was unsure whether the fact this was done without his knowing was something he should worry about.
    Neuro was especially happy. Vedal and the swarm must've been planning this for her! 
        
    She and Vedal would soon lead the world by their noses and end all war. They would fund new medical science, making it Impossible for new great plagues such as those of the 6th and 14th centuries. This was their dream. As for their social awkwardness, Annie, which had volunteered to call herself a mother to Neuro, would take care of their reputation staying stable to some extent.</p>
        
    Everything was perfectly set.
    
    
    Vedal: "Wait! This is 100% a flag! Princess? Mother? They're clearly planning to take me away from apple rum!"
        
    If only we could stop moving forwards trough time... I'd freeze this moment for all eternity. The day I knew: Love.
