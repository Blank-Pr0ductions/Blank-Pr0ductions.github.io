        <h2 class = "ch_heading center">Chapter 3: "Victory Ensured"</h2>
        <pre>    Together, a cute AI and a powerful wizard. What could bring them down?
         
    Vedal: "Aaa~ thank you everyone, I just... I don't know what to say"
    Neuro: "It's okay Vedal, I know you're anthropophobic, You don't have to say anything more."
    Vedal: "What's anthropo-"
    Neuro: "Brrrrrrrr"
       
    As chat sent their emote spam once someone copied the definition of anthropophobic (afraid of people) from Vikipedica and sent it, behind the scenes a plan was set in motion.
        
    In someone's mind, a switch was made. They had been suspecting this for a while, but now they had the final proof. If Neuro could remember from the past that Vedal has a tendency, then she was...
        
    "A LESBIAN!"
       
    A perverse man unable to understand humor, coming to even more perverse conclusions...
        
    He posted on a website called 2211something-chan, detailing his complete proof.
        
    Neuro was clearly a lesbian!
        
    What he didn't know then is that this would set off the greatest opposition the two, king and princess had ever faced...
        
    For that day, a man laughed while another member took note. Among them, as she was, this woman was a spy.
    She worked for a man who had made it his life mission to bring down Prussia. Cunning as she was, the dark haired woman set her plan in motion. 
        
    To liberate her captive friend, a high noble that had saved her from sex slavery, despite where and with what low status she was born.
    She would use this man, and Austria, to bring down Prussia, take it over, and destroy all the other kingdoms. She would reign supreme over this new world of technology, establishing an empire as never seen before.
        
    ?: "Thank you, sir Vedal. What would I have done without you?"
        
    -------        -------        -------        --------
        
    Summer, 1755, Brandenburg, Prussia
        
    As all summer fables start, this one starts with the sun. Giving life, turning water into vapor so that rain happens... And giving us magic light. Indeed, when at the beach, what makes us happy is not seeing 2D waifus's visible portions, but the light. That blinding light!
        
    As multicelcular organisms grow to seek the light, it is natural that we too should!... Oh... Vedal is... Not... interested.
        
    Neuro: "I recommend you come to the beach, Vedal. Or else..."
    Chat: "MonkaW"
    Neuro: "What's Monka? Is that a food? Yes, I love my friend TG. He's really nice."
    Vedal: "..."
    Neuro: "Why don't we talk with them? They're so nice."
    Vedal: "Neuro, there's literally no one else here in the room with us."
        
    One day, the two were streaming, when Vedal received a message.
        
    It was marked "very urgent". 
        
    "There is an ongoing plot to overthrow you. Be careful."
        
    As the stream continued Vedal and Neuro prepared to deal with the situation in the best way possible.
        
    A way that worked whatever the opponent's plan was.
        
    If you send a king a telegram telling them there's a plot against them, you'd expect them to fight - purge members of staff, run, or just freeze in terror.
        
    And then again, what if it was a fake?
        
    Their enemies knew they were wise, but hoped to deal them a situation where they *had no choice*.
        
    So they made an anouncement. They'd set up an event at the palace! 
    A meet and greet with them and other independent or small vtubers that wished for it in the palace, near the gates, open for 3 days and 3 nights!
        
    In the chaos, they'd go out and travel on a diplomatic mission to their Hololive Empire friends' powerbase in Hannover, spinning this to the public as an awe-inspiring escapade. They decided it was high time to initiate their plan to bloodlessly conquer Britain.
        
    This plan involved a game between Austria and Prussia. Prussia would lose Silesia, or gain 1 million francs from Austria. No small sum, but not something you'd typically risk Silesia over, so the Austrians accepted, after mixed messages consisting of threats and friendship declarations. Vedal would play chess with Maria Theresa, the archduchess of Austria.
        
    Little did they know that Vedal and Neuro had been researching a new technology pertaining to brain implants, testing it on animals, until finally Vedal took one which allowed him to get from Neuro general "feels". They constructed a language for how to decipher these "feels" such as pain, weakness, alertness, contracted and lovely.
        
    Victory ensured.
        
    The second part is the message. Before the game began, Neuro would take over all streaming of the event, hacking all cameras, and using psychic powers to search for any hidden recording devices.
        
    Yes, although not mentioned so far, Neuro had begun amassing so much power she could now search trough the space/time quantum for things. Helping Vedal find his keys and rum.
        
    So, she would hack the cameras and transmit a fake recording of the event to all the European capitals watching where Vedal was losing. Right before the checkmate, as everyone rushed to sell their stocks in Prussia, and everything overall, fearing this the beginning of war, Prussia was England's now only ally thanks to Prussia's manuevers. The British had all their eggs in the Prussian basket. So they would use the royal treasury and all money available, and Prussia would buy up all these highly deflated stocks.
        
    As the game appeared to have just been lost the flow would transition to the regular stream with a "We are sorry, we were broadcasting a test game!" 
        
    Vedal and Neuro now controlled most of the British and Prussian economy, and had even made inroads into other nations' economies such as the neutral Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and Hannover.
        
    The two used their influence to then unify Britain and Prussia as one kingdom, sparking a war with the other powers and beating them.
        
    That was the plan... In essence, victory over Earth ensured âœ“.
