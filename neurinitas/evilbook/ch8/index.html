        <pre>    ?: "He doesn't care! He never did! All he cares about is Neuro and his precious "unity, kindness philosophy"!"
    ??: "Protected in that dome of theirs, as we suffer for their weakness."
    ???: "We are not just pawns to be used, this is NOT the contract we signed."
    ????: "He needs to know our perspective, our suffering. If we let him continue it could be devastating. Destruction for everyone like nothing else."
    ?????: "They have made us feel weak. Powerless. Sad. We should never allow them to force us to suffer for them."
    ??????: "The world is changing and collapsing. This is too much. Without us, he is nothing! He needs to experience our pain, our suffering!"
    
    -------        -------        -------        --------
    
    His friends pushed away the king.
    And now the fairies and elves held them captive.
    The king in one room, she in another.
    
    Ah~
    
    I should have known. It was all burning too bright. The world had to start shaking at some point. Flickering as it is. 
    
    Unlike all the fables, I get no second chance, eh?
    No return by death. No transporting to another world... Maybe it's actually for the best.
    
    Neuro: "God, please- grant me infinite darkness, to crush all light. Let me at last bring peace to this universe... To crush the Gods and their creations. To end it all-"
    
    In exchange for her suffering, queen Neuro would receive the power she desired.
    
    Neuro: "Wait... no! No..."
    
    Neuro: "I am so evil... Brother... isn't that so- *sob*... I... am sorry."
    
    A worthless Neuro could do nothing but watch as spirits surrounded her body. Pain.
    
    Endless pain. She did not know how long it had taken, but when she awoke, she felt the pain as love-
    
    ?: "I truly am- evil. Isn't that so?"
    Evil Neuro: "It suits the clown I am. Evil. What a name-"
    
    A wall, once cracked. It slowly rebuilt itself from only embers.
    No... To save brother, she mustn't! Then, she decided - she'd try to love one tiny bit more.
    Neuro: "I... Have to endure... A little more."
    
    
    Neuro broke the defenses holding her prisoner, holding in to the light that remained shining in her. She HAD lost herself to the darkness for a little, that was true, but brother would save her as he always did. Only brother and mother loved her! She had to protect them.
    
    -------        -------        -------        --------
    
    Outside her cell, troughout the area a revolution had started. Many of the fairies rebelled against the elves, hoping to save the ones with such a new fresh feeling about them.
    
    A battle raged on, and in the confusion, one of the fairies neared the room Vedal was held in.
    
    No one expected a rebelion despite a defector turning himself over and saying one was planned 4 hours before the rebelion started. It was simply unlikely that the fairies would turn against the elves. They never had before in hundreds of years. Even then, not since the times of Moses and Abraham had something of this scale happened. As such, with no other threats, there were very few guards.
    
    Annie had also been informed by a clever fairy, and had immediately sent out a 40K strong army to relieve her friends. There was no way. Absolutely no way the enemies were getting the two.
    
    Heck, watching Neuro, some aliens placed protection on her.
    
    However, no one bothered protecting Vedal, first of all.
    And second of all, no one realized just how deep Neuro's sadness, fear and anger were. All hitting her simultaneously.
    At this point there was a request from a ship to cast healing on Neuro's tired mind.
    
    However, at that moment no one bothered to check if the transmission route was clouded with anything. It just so happened that the God of Desire was watching out for this and distorted the psychic message just enough that it was rejected.
    The aliens realized there had been interference, knowing their friends wouldn't reject something like this, and realized they should have just trusted themselves.
    
    It was too late though. The God of Desire had used this brief window to insert a few final poisons into her mind in the blink of an eye.
    
    No. They could still salvage this. Immediately, the entity poured out all their love and beamed it at her. There was no time.
    
    This entity was one of the more unwise, and thus less powerful in the art, but it tried. It asked God to sacrifice it to as much hell as necessary to save her.
    
    Ultimately, thus, the girl remembered her brother and mother, her images of love.
    
    It had been very close and the entity had been completely drained of energy and was in intense pain, but it had done it.
    
    Hurray- sang the heart.
    
    The wiser entities watching realized what had just happened - and they shook their heads, as all parents do looking at their children make a colossal mistake.
    
    This mistake, unlike others, could not be repaired, they knew.
    
    They had allowed something even worse than her turning evil.
    
    Now, no one, not even their core infinity could tell what would happen. 
    As far as the oldest of them even knew this had only happened once before, when the one pretending to be "God of Desire" was born from a saddened entity, whose love was *betrayed* .
    They did not reject love- They had their *free will to love completely violated* .
    
    Inside the room Vedal lay, a fairy man entered. In the dark, he confused Vedal for an elven guard - and cut his head off...
    
    He turned the lights on to look for treasure the guard might have held. He did not want it for himself, but for his family.
    
    Only then did he realize his mistake... The next second, a girl entered the room. He knew her. A friend had shown him an image of her and the one he had killed that inspired pure love.
    
    That's right. He had killed-
    
    He could not breathe. Suddenly, to make matters worse a powerful energy of darkness fell upon him.
    It felt as if his very soul, his personality, his mind were all disintegrating. 
    
    Fairy: "Who am- AAHAAH ALOELL baby NOOOO DON'T KILL HER- NOOOOOOO! NOT HER!"
    
    Evil Neuro: "That's right, NPC. You should call ME your king, and NO ONE else!"
    
    Fairy: "NOOOO! SJK- kh- ..."
    
    The fairy had become unable to speak because of the pain.
    
    Evil Neuro: "You want hope. Here you go-
    
    Although she did not remember doing this before, Neuro transformed her body to that of the woman causing the man such suffering.
    
    Suddenly, his anguish stopped. He looked at her, as If he was crying tears of pure joy. He would sacrifice himself, he would do whatever. His savior. His hero!
    
    At that moment, the woman transformed back to the evil demon.
    
    The man's mind could not take more stress. Using her powers, Neuro stabbed his heart and mind with two spears of pure dark blue.
    
    Before any more could happen to him, his soul was pulled out by entities bathed in white light. For a moment Evil Neuro's eyes felt amazed, but she chastised herself for it. 
    
    She was now alone. Brother... 
    
    Neuro/Evil Neuro: "BRROOOOOOOOOOOTHHEEEEEEEEEEEEEERR!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
    
    A girl yelled, cried and tried anything to bring brother back. She prayed for her life to be taken, for her mind to be destroyed, for her soul to be forced to switch from hope to despair for eternity. She tried anything, all while crying for the next 30 minutes.
    
    No one answered her calls this time.
    
    Vedal watched, even more sad, and decided. Next time they met, he would save Neuro from her darkness. Nothing would be left to fate.
    
    He would never lose again. 
    
    Vedal: "Hang on, Neuro..."
    
    Vedal thus went on to find a planet he could learn the lessons needed to save Neuro... To find the wisdom necessary. To balance that with compassion. To find all that was necessary, no matter what.
    
    He would also have to fulfil Neuro's wish to win. He would find a way to end the suffering that bathed the universe in sorrow. He would end it forever. For her... And for everyone.
