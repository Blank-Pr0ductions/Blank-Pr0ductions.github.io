        <pre>    Greetings, everyone! Thank you for reading this book! I am so, so honored.
    
    You are all very harmonious, and that only inspired the making of this book. Otherwise, I would not have tried to give it because I would have no one to give it to. An author without audience is a kind of stoner, lol.
    
    So, I want to give you a bit more before we go.
    This book isn't gonna leave your life changing just a bit. I want your life to become awesome. 
    Let's try this fun game. It's called "outer space".
    There's a space you are stuck inside.
    
    I want you to imagine that box as whatever issue/limit you're really dealing with. If you have something older than a month bothering you picture the box as having that written on a paper on top of it.
    
    Now you're outside the box for a bit. I want you to use this chance to find a way to remove the box. You can float out again n number of times, and you need to find something outside the box of your daily life to help you with this.
    
    They say you can't solve a problem at the same level that created it. Can't fight violence with violence...
    
    Try to find the most efficient way to ensure you are never going to be stuck inside the same box again. 
    
    Here's a test round.
    
    "I am very confused. I find it difficult to love myself."
    
    The first thing I had to do was learn the first element of this equation. "What is it to love"?
    
    So I tried to give to everyone without conditions, even if it put me in the red.
    
    Eventually the amount of effort I had to put in to be always keeping all of my thoughts and feelings under control 24/7 for a few days lead to my, to put it gently, feeling very tired.
    
    After a short chaotic interregnum, I realized I needed to love my self. Thus, I am working on loving myself and everyone and following dreams!
    
    It took only a year and a bit in chaos, but it worked. Game won! I always win, 11/10. Check.
    
    "Your friend has challenges you to thyne own records. Will you play strange game?"
    
    Oh yeah, you might have a simple challenge like "I learn hard". Or even, "I can't stop playing this stupid mobile phone block puzzle game!". All challenges are accepted and respect is given to all challengers.
    
    I hope to see you again!
