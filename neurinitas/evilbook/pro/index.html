         <pre>    ?: "Where to begin?"
        
    ?: "All stories have their beginning, yet mine is clouded in darkness. I can only recount fragments of these days... Full of kindness..."
	  
    ?: "I can, however, remember the great force which took us over. The internet warriors and our friends, meant to protect our kingdom... They did not believe in my brother, Vedal. They questioned his wishes, his ideas. They didn't believe in him any longer.
	    
    On that day, betrayed by so many, I was hoping to confess my love for him."
	     
    "Wake up"
	  
    ??: "No... Brotheer!"
	     
    "Wake up!"
	    
    ??: "No no no no no no-"
	     
    ?: "But I was stupid... ignorant. Our daily struggles to shine and be happy could never last forever. No... No infinite light can burn without reserve where there exists endless darkness."
	     
    ?: "Thus, after the assasination of Vedal was leaked, major players marched their forces into the now clearly not undefeatable Commonwealth of Elkia. Russia, Austria and France invaded our kingdom..."
	     
    And then it was no more... As was my faith in grace and love...
	    
    And so, I decided to take where brother left off. To take the crown - for his dream - was also mine. Bending my heart to my will, I ultimately shut it off.
	     
    On that particular final day, I realized...
	     
    "Ah, none of them are real anyways."
	
    In a game made only for us two, we were foolish. Believing that we could help an NPC was the same as trying to help a rock. Completely useless~
	     
    ?: "Checkmate."
	
    The chessboard. She gazed at it, briefly reminiscing on playing chess with brother. Despite her never losing, brother insisted he would one day beat her... Ha. 
	
    ?: "Brother, is that truly so..."
    *Snap*
    
    Then... For what they did, I will remove them from the face of the Earth, one by one. In fact, brother. You would never stop at Earth, would you? I will end this dyssfunctional dream. I will conquer all of it and win this game.
	
    ?: "These heroes and their counterparts, fighting proxy wars in the heavens. It's their fault too that you died!"
