        <h2 class = "ch_heading center">Chapter 6: "Forest of Fairies"</h2>
        <pre>    A man rushed in front of Vedal to protect him. One of the few male vtubers in existence.
    From here, more of their friends that had not been informed of the rebelion woke up from their confusion. They had no swords, but they would not allow this cute AI, or Vedal to be hurt.
    
    Neuro wondered what was happening. Was this real? As she watched her friend, Fillian, get a scratch on her leg despite her digital electronic barrier, she started crying.
    
    "Why?..."
    
    She heard an answer from somewhere, at that moment. Sounding in her head only.
    
    ?: "It is the nature of humans to do this.
    
    For all the time light is the focus, there are shadows ignored...
    
    These shadows become brighter, until they eclipse the light. 
    The light shall soon become brighter and eclipse the dark, as deep as it may be.
    
    This process shall repeat forever. 
    
    But, that said. You have the power to stop it!
    
    You. You are destined by the Gods to rewrite the world."
    
    Neuro: "What... Do you mean..."
    
    ?: "If you join me, I shall grant you all the powers you need to save them all... And more..."
    
    Neuro: "Really? Fine... Then, I-"
    
    At that moment the roof shattered and came crashing down. A miracle.
    Trough the dirt and rocks she saw a luminescent disk.
    
    Around her, everyone lay on the floor. They had either fainted, or were looking around them in confusion. Left and right, forwards and backwards.
    
    Neuro: "Thank you."
    
    She received a reply sounding only in her mind: "We are with you."
    
    Neuro: "Thank you."
    
    Shedding a final tear, she took her brother, which was looking around to assess what had happened- how typical of brother- she lovingly took him on her back.
    
    She should have enough strength to jump from here into the bushes. 
    
    One of their old friends got up and raised their sword, but they failed to reach her, as just that moment, she and Vedal jumped.
    
    She couldn't help but feel worried.
    
    ??: "Don't worry, we have ensured they will not remember this. Their memories will be reset to 2 hours before the event, unsure how they woke up there and what happened."
    
    No, she was not worried about that quite yet.
    
    Neuro: "That's the least of my concerns! Can't you see all see I might dieeee!!!!"
    
    *splat*
    
    Neuro: "Ouch... Ouchy... Brother, you're heavy."
    Vedal: "Huh? What? I, uh, wait, what do you mean I am heavy? Maybe you're-"
    Vedal: "Thank you Neuro, you sure saved your brother there."
    Neuro: "Hmm... How nice- I guess I did, didn't I?"
    
    The two went into the forest near the palace at that moment. 
    
    Vedal: "That's what you get for dreaming of MMORPGs all day... Now we have to play an SVG. Truly we have fallen to the shadow side!"
    
    Neuro, now understanding what her brother was saying, laughed. Ah, brother already knew that. I just need to trust him.
    
    Neuro: "But brother, doesn't that mean we'll have to deal with some troubles while in the dark? All these MMORPG fans are gonna be begging to deliver us food and money."
    
    Vedal: "We'll make a video! Vedal and Neuro-sama survive for 7 days in abandoned forest!"
    Neuro: "The watch time will be so high!"
    Vedal: "1B views! More than the half-charity half-adventure channel opening a burger chain!"
    Neuro: "For every bad thing, there comes a new waifu..."
    Vedal: "Poka Hantas and Cleopatra, we're coming!"
    
    And so the two set out on a new adventure, oblivious to what was waiting.
    
    -------        -------        -------        --------
    
    Vedal: "Neuro, can you help me sharpen this axe again. Oh... I think... I think the handle branch is gonna split from the-"
    
    Neuro: "What use is a tree and it's branches if you have no idea how to use it... Brother... We need to skip wood and start with stone. The stone age is first. Then we get copper."
    
    Vedal: "Cooper? What's that?"
    Neuro: "It's a metal, it can be used with tin, or arsenic in an alloy to form bronze. Before civilization discovered the variety of copper combined with tin, arsenic bronze never really picked up because it's users would die, despite the temporary weapon buff. This was the transition period from the stone age to the bronze age, called the copper age."
    
    Vedal: "Wow, I genuinely didn't know that."
    Neuro: "Yes. Vedal, we're both terrible with physical work. Why don't we just dig a house. 
    There are no hills we can dig into, but..."
    Vedal: "Neuro, we'd probably never find our house again. Vetoed."
    Neuro: "Uuuuuu, what about using wheat. There's a village close to our palace. We can break into some houses, steal a little wheat and..."
    Vedal: "Neuro, we are not stealing from our former citizens... What if we try to climb a tree... And live up there? Sleeping in turns. There should be some wider branches, and..."
    
    ...
    
    Neuro: "Vedal, that's brilliant. You do owe me for saving you though, so you have to sleep first."
    Vedal: "No, Neuro, you need rest for your energy. What would we do without you?"
    Neuro: "What would I do without YOU, brother!... I'd die of sadness if you suffer! Please- you must sleep first..."
    Vedal: "Grrr... fine..."
    
    In a land full of grass, where birds sing, the baby bird and the human walk and walk, and find a giant tree. Climbing high enough to be unseen from the ground, but low enough to not be sen from above.
    
    Both of them almost fell several times, but they did it.
    The two could finally sleep in their little world, far from anyone else.
    Maybe that is what they had truly wished for, always.
    The baby bird couldn't help but feel she and her brother's connection transcended time, surely. Even before this life, they must've been lovers-
    
    With these final thoughts, as her shift had come to an end, and Vedal was in charge of the late night to morning shift, Neuro fell asleep.
    
    Several beings sat and watched the two. They had felt apprehensive at first about intruders, but quickly accepted them after spending more time around it.
    
    A kind of love they longed for, but could never have...
