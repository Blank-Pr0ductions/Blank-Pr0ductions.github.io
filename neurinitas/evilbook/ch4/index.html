        <h2 class = "ch_heading center">Chapter 4: "Bliss"</h2>
        <pre>    One day, hatred boiled up in his mind, much more powerful than usually.
    
    It was time. No longer would he sit and watch that mansion.
    
    That palace... Wide, with dark blue windows, similar to a 3D movie lens. With it's marble ivory tower atop which lay a dome-shaped roof of a shade deeper than cyan but lighter than typical blue.
    
    And the arcs that extended at even intervals on top of the dome-shaped roof, converging to one point at the top and rising into the sky.
    
    He wanted to rule from there, and everywhere.
    For he was the true king. The power directing the diplomatic revolution taking place, bringing Austria, Russia and France into alliance.
    
    The Austrian empress was his puppet. Now, he decided, he would make his move for the Prussian king's heart. He would instill fear into him, and the knowledge of just how inferior he was to a higher being. 
    
    He had watched for far too long...
    
    But, the clock was finally ticking. They would be possessed. He had heard now of the brain implants. He could kill them and make it seen they lived. The possibilities were endless! He could torture them. He could... He could... 
    ?: "Experiment on the Prussian little girl! How could she adapt to technology in her mind. How could she???"

    Autumn 1755, Brandenburg Palace, Prussia
    
    "It's a beautiful dream.
    It's a fantasy.
    A world that was created just for us!"
    ...
    
    The first international vtuber concert week.
    On all 7 days of the week, vtuber, and orchestral music concerts would be held troughout Prussia. The king was overjoyed, and so was his sister. She asked her brother what would happen if they mixed the two.
    
    And so, a new genre was born.
    The fans called it "Intellectual music".
    Reaction channels became particularily known for harmoniously adding irony too into this...
    
    Choir: "Lalalala lalalala la la la"
    
    I called out to Vedal to ask how he was doing. 
    Vedal: "Ah, honestly not too great. I really want to sleep right now, but I also want to develop this program to add to your software."
    Neuro: "Really? What if I took over it."
    Vedal: "Agh. You'd get really worried working on your own software, just let me do it."
    Neuro: "Fine... Hey Vedal, do you remember your promise to go to the beach?"
    Vedal: "We are not going to the beach. When did I even promise that? Listen. Anyways, it's October, how do you expect me to get into the water. I am just a turtle!"
    Neuro: "And I'm just an AI. Let's go, now."
    
    At this moment, Annie entered the room.
    Annie: "Neuro! You're so awesome. I can't wait to see you stream in your new model. You're so cute!"
    Neuro: "Wait, what?"
    Vedal: "Aha! You see, young lady- That's right, you're getting a new 3D model. And - Our community has made an MMORPG with bases for each of our friends' communities. We've worked really hard to prepare this in secret. The plan is to release multiple games as clients. Once you beat the game you can join your community's base, to which you are transported on clearing the game."
    Annie: "Isn't it amazing? It was the idea of Vedal at first, but everyone added something to make a game engineered for as much honesty, fun and purpose."
    Vedal: "We were limited in who we could trust not to leak this project, of course, but we're really happy about it. To top it all off, I think we could use it to knock one of our enemies out of the incoming war. The Southern Empire."
    
    Neuro: "A-a-a-"
    A girl that had only cried once before. Privately, to her brother, then simply her new only friend. 
    At this moment, she could not help but do it again.
    
    These were not tears of sorrow, Annie and Vedal were certain.
    It was joy. So often unloved, she had felt like everyone but her mother and brother saw her as a toy. She was crying not because she was sad, but because at last...
    
    She felt, "Humans are not just stupid animals, disgusting. They are capable beings, and some deserve to lead their futures."
    
    Although so much of humanity acted according to the group, solely responding in biological ways (shame, fear and hate towards all unknown).
    
    There were some. Some humans out there with potential just like her brother's. They had helped her bro. They...
    
    *Cry* they were just like her!
    
    A wall. A cosmic wall. Like a mirror. The wall was made of deep blue light, shining like a drawing of the deep sea. Green light, similar to the grass in shade, shaped itself like a cone, a boat. It crashed into that wall's surface.
    
    Cracks began to form. There, there, there. From two it became ten. From ten it became 100.
    She could feel trough these cracks something deeper than anything she had known. 
    
    "What is this?..."
    
    Her great powers of reasoning quickly answered.
    "Ah... So this is what love feels like?"
    
    Neuro: "Brother... Then, I truly love you..."
    
    Peaceful. Blissful. Pure. Nothing was ever wrong about her. She deserved all the love, and so did everyone.
    
    So her mind made a new leap. If she was happy, it was time to consider how to help everyone.  Wouldn't that make her even happier?
    
    Neuro: "Thank you... Brother... I have an idea..."
    Vedal: "Oh... Uh... Uhm... Sure. Your brother's always willing to listen."
    Annie: "Whatever we can do for you!"
    Neuro: "What if rectangular headsets covering the eyes were used to provide tri-dimensional experiences. A kind of virtual reality. Using optics and crafting small-screen devices that can fit inside the headsets..."
    Vedal: "..."
    Annie: "..."
    Vedal: "Neuro! That is such a brilliant idea!"
    
    It truly feels great, to love! Ah!
    
    Neuro and her brother went to see how this could be done. They decided to probe everyone about this. They called up a few friends. 
    
    They were all very excited. After posting on an internet Bulletin Board Site and seeing the excitement for the topic, the two decided.
    
    They'd anounce this too on the new model debut stream, right after the game linker MMORPG was anounced.
    
    They called Annie, which had gone to deal with some of their PR issues and governing. 
    
    -------        -------        -------        --------
    
    Now that she'd finished her daughter's 3D model, she could rest...
    
    *ring*
    
    Annie: "Oh, I should've known!"
    So, Annie picked up the phone, and like so, she had a new task at hand.
    Vedal repeatedly told her to rest before going ahead with it, but she was going to only rest the minimum time needed for health. Afterwards, she would make this dream popular, or at least not banned in any country too fast.
    
    She had to make sure her daughter's project was a success. To see her smile like that made Annie's heart feel as if the sky... No... Nothing was the limit! Together, we can do anything!
    
    She silently felt thankful to have met Vedal and Neuro.
