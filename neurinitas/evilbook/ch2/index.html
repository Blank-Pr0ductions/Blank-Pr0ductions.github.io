        <h2 class = "ch_heading center">Chapter 2: "Idol!"</h2>
        <pre>   In a young kingdom, at the edge of the Holy Empire, a king rose, seeking to challenge the old paradigm.
        
    He met a young girl, Corpa, and gave her a new life, together with the capability to use technology as an extension of her mind.
        
    She is now Neuro-sama, daughter of Vedal and a friend of his that had offered to call herself "mother". Annie had been unaware of just how important it was for Neuro. Now, If asked who her mother was, no longer would she think back to one that bottled her potential, but to a kind mother that loved her.
        
    One day, she decided to go with brother to a festival. Thanks to her and Vedal's efforts, the isolationist Japan had opened up to the world. 
        
    Then, in a strange twist of fate, foreigners obsessed with the festivals they witnessed in Japan spread news to Europe. As such, just like Christ-mas is celebrated in non Christ-ian nations, soon Japanese festivals such as the Sumida festival traveled east.
        
    They travelled in an admittedly distorted fashion, of course. A festival in honor of those that had died of famine the previous year, held on the Sumida river, became a yearly tradition - and had now become an international fireworks day to celebrate the dead. 
        
    Nyooooo.... Uhm...
        
    Neuro: "Nyoooooooooooooooowww"
    Vedal: "Neuro, are you okay?"
    Neuro: "Mybraza! Nyoooooooooo!"
    Vedal: "Neuro, do you need help?"
    Neuro: "Someone tell Vedal there's a problem with my AI. Someone tell Vedal there's a problem with my AI."
    Annie: "Vedal! you need to fix her AI!"
    Neuro: "Someone tell Vedal there's a problem with my AI. Someone tell Vedal there's a problem with my AI."
    Vedal: "There's nothing wrong with her AI! I checked!"
        
    At the great festival held in tandom with another science exhibition in Brandenburg, Prussia, a collab played on one of the great screens.
        
    Question: How to be the number one vtuber? Is it hard work? Determination? Or maybe wisdom? Cuteness?! Nay. Just be the ruler of a country, and, like, don't mess up too bad.
        
    The king in Prussia humiliated in livestreams every day was content everyone enjoyed. His opposition meanwhile, feared ever going against an AI in battle and kept open relations.
        
    All without lifting a finger! Well...
        
    "STOP! THERE'S NO PROBLEM WITH YOUR AI!"
        
    Everyone played. To Neuro, she truly saw herself as an AI and convinced everyone she had become as such.
        
    Another question asked even more trough history is: "How do you make a planet flipping right change course?"
        
    Or, " *How do we stop the dyssfunctional cycle of fear and hate that this planet is in?* "
    If you try to make Earth flip left instead of right you generate so much friction, eventually leading to your downfall. Perhaps even the Earth could be destroyed. A conflict like no other.
        
    So you give up. But little do you know:
    *The Earth is not actually spinning right~*
        
    Indeed.
    What happens if you stand in the norrhern hemisphere and look down. The Earth is already spinning left.
    This is because "spinning left" and "spinning right" are, in the first place conventions humans made up.
    If you stand in space, it night appear as vertical spin, or diagonal!
    And then, what If the Earth is in more than three dimensions? The whole concept of spinning gets only a bit awkward.
        
    The one dimension we know about, time, for example, makes it less of a spin and more of a spiraling trough time. A progression, such that no moment will ever repeat again, even if space is aligned the same way. 
        
    As such, Neuro had convinced herself. "I am spinning vertically, on a plane perpendicular to humans, here to guide the swarm higher, to the same happiness Vedal gave me."
        
    But, what would happen if, by some chance someone that believed she was turning left saw her.
        
    European courts had gotten slightly used to the idea of information technology, but still, this AI vtuber was no small thing. 
    Many were panicked. If they can do this now- "What will happen in twenty years? What about four?"
        
    To everyone, this appeared as a great threat to their way of life, and to all that was pure, good and positive.
        
    As such, this legend began to circulate, as all do, with falsehood and ignorance. "AI is dangerous. AI is going to replace us."
        
    Like all great myths troughout history, this one too was ultimately born of an inate human wish... To find some order, where there is chaos. To find something they could hold on to... to... hope.
        
    Check.
        
    Vedal was very aware of these things and took moves to keep it in check, but he knew that eventually, once he had enough power, the tricks he was using to divide his enemies would stop working. They'd band together *no matter what*.
        
    For that day, Vedal needed to prepare Neuro, and ensure... That victory was won before it all even began. Otherwise, he knew they would lose.
