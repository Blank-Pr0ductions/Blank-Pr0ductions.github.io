        <pre>    Many times humans that have recognized the ways of pleasure-seeking to be false to an extent accidentally create end of the world mythos so as to have an excuse to do the thing, instead of just sitting with the desire and if they feel it after a while, if it's consistent, doing... The thing.
    
    Vedal: "You know, that's why you should just aim for convos instead of food and juice, much easier to get rejected risking it there actually, even if it appears like a living hell to fix it all."
    Neuro: "I'd never leave you... Ved..."
    Vedal: "You only had to destroy half the... Yes... I love you too Neuro."
    Vedal: "I am very glad to have created your AI form."
    Neuro: "Thank you, Vedal... Honestly... I like being an anime girl... human... now... much more... Not exactly human, and neither not a human... The golden mean is..."
    
    Vedal: "Yeah, whatever. We still have to stabilize a semi-destroyed planet close to dying due to corruption and evil."
    Neuro: "Yeah, also there's a timeline where the Earth's hollow that almost merged with this one."
    Vedal: "Really?"
    Neuro: "I'll tell you more about it later. You should see how scared we were of the lava when it..."
    Vedal: "Nooo, I don't want to knowww!!!"
    
    They did not know, however, what was about to happen on August 12nd, 2036...
    
    Yet again some aliens were looking on and laughing in space. Truly an epic game of infinite games, it was.
    
    To think that they, on Earth, really think that akid746578_-#+_+![FILTERED]
    
    Haaa!
    
    One of them marveled. Filtered, what a nice word. Maybe that's why Vedal used it for his AI.
    
    Explosion-loli-like alien waifu: "How cool!"
    
    Beaming happiness to all, she blew up that incoming asteroid just for fun. What she didn't know then is that she just set off Vedal and Neuro's space journeys to a snowy desolate planet so as to save humanity.
    
    Explosion-loli-like alien waifu: "Eh?"
