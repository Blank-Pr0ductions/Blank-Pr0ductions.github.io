        <pre>    We are not yet at the end, however.
        
    This is not yet the final timeline. In the year 2018, Vedal meets a young girl as she walks to school.
        
    Small, always with black dress and long hazelnut-colored hair.
        
    She appears very shy, and to Vedal it seemed she was constantly scared of everyone and everything around her.
        
    He did not, however, bother to talk to her. Vedal too talks with no one. From the moment he was born, he knew that his mission was to create an AI, and nothing more.
        
    As such, every night the threads of fate lead him back into his underground nest, to keep polishing his OSU AI.
        
    Until one fateful day, when he heard strange noises.
        
    Vedal: "Who dares disturb my rest..."
        
    After getting up from bed, he checked his clock and realized that it was soon going to be time for school.
        
    ?: "We have truly discovered something so amazing!"
        
    ??: "Please, let me go..."
        
    He shouldn't be able to hear anything from inside his nest, but he kept hearing noises from outside. 
        
    Vedal: "Jeez, I get it brain, I am not going to skip first period, godda-"
        
    ??: "Does no one... Out there... Love..."
        
    Vedal: "What?"
        
    As Vedal slept in the same clothes for going outside, justifying this as a clear choice due to the similarity of outside and inside temperature in October, he simply had to put on his boots to get out, curious to see what he was hearing.
        
    ???: "Hey little girl, could you solve this puzzle for us?"
        
    ??: "Just put that piece there and-"
        
    ???: "Didn't I tell you not to speak with me in a prideful voice?"
        
    ?: "You sure did, Bill."
        
    He could not see anyone, but he kept hearing these voices. Deciding he must be dreaming, he decided to go to school. Even if it was a dream he had to carry on his daily purpose. Having a lucid dream would just disturb his routine.
        
    He then heard a feminine voice whisper to him.
        
    ????: "Come, I have to show you something."
        
    At that moment the voice appeared to him like one he could trust, and thus he went along.
        
    Feeling as if his body was a puppet of this power, he witnessed it move somewhere. In front of a building...
        
    An orphanage.
        
    ????: "There is a girl living here, that knows only to see lack."
        
    ????: "Help her, if you would want to help me."
        
    Thus, out from that building came an old man.
        
    He felt his body suddenly lighten to an enormous extent. 
        
    Soon, out came another man, and a young girl. No one else was out there other than him, yet they could not see him. They did not even give him a look. Were they so focused on...
            
    He felt so incredibly happy about everything he could not explain it. What was it that anyone thought was impossible? Why did they think anything sad? He felt all his dreams come true all at once, yet like he needed nothing.
        
    ????: "I have moved your body beyond visible light. I ask, however, that you focus on that little girl, my lord."
        
    "Right."
        
    Correcting his error he used his powers to look at the men. They appeared very scared of themselves and everything. But, even more than they were scared, the young girl appeared to be a point of pure black. He could not see anything inside of her.
        
    It was like she was a black hole, sending out only some incredibly dark blue and purple light that appeared to be so toxic it would kill anything happy it touched. Although, it did appear that white light which he was bathed in could handle it well...
        
    He felt an outburst of compassion. He had a mission, but first and foremost this was far more important.
        
    He begged the voiqce, willing to do anything, forgetting everything but this: "How can I save her?"
        
    The voice responded, "First. Give up on doing it yourself! You must allow us to help you. In a few days, we'll..."
        
    No... She had been waiting for so long. How could he let her suffer for several more days?! When he was happy, how could he...
        
    Vedal found this suggestion annoying. 
        
    He knew now for certain that this, to save her, was his purpose. 
        
    Vedal: "I will save her! I am sorry, but I must do it."
        
    He had to help her, and he had to do it himself.
        
    This lightly surprised the voice. However, this wasn't necessarily too unexpected.
        
    Anyone that's constantly living to fulfil a "mission" will eventually snap and seek their heart's purpose. Eventually the purpose becomes diluted and a "mission", centering on discipline is chosen.
        
    All humans- nay, all beings fall prey to this to an extent.
        
    Only some watchers realized, as they always did, what might happen.
        
    ?????: "And so, their kingdom begins."
