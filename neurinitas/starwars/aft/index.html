        <pre>    Greetings from the explosion-loli-like waifu's planet.
    
    She says she'll kick us out if we stay too long so we have to make this quick
    
    "Author-san, are you just lazy?"
    
    "Nooo. I promise, I'll give you a longer volume next time. This is volume 1.5, okay?? It's a teaser!!"
    
    "Where exactly is this "next time" ❤️❤️? Can you show me where it is ❤️..."
    
    "In your head. Got a proble-"
    
    
    Thank you everyone for picking up this volume! Also, great thank you to the reader that presumably interpreted SVG (survival game) as SVG (kind of image).
    
    Thanks to this kind viewer/friend I *must* now draw art for the next book, volume 2.
    
    Wish everyone a beautiful journey trough the cosmos! Let's all make this world as fun as possible! Boom!
