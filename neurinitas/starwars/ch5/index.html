        <h2 class = "ch_heading center">Chapter 5: "Moving The Pieces"</h2>
        <pre>    "I remember you from a dream I thought was true.
    You bright with magic, and I blinded by my youth.
    All I wish is for your hand to hold, you see-
    Only your smile kills - the dark in me." - Fragment from AmaLee cover of Magia, Madoka Magica.
    
    What happens if you win the entire world. Are you happy?
    
    How many countries? 
    
    How much more reason will you find to do this?
    
    Soon, a man that answered "as much as I feel like" teleported Vedal and Neuro to him.
    
    It's very strange. Despite being brilliant strategic masterminds, they used real names. At first he couldn't believe it, but there it was.
    
    The hide and seek trick where you hide "behind the eyelids" while your opponent searches everywhere, the whole universe, never looking inside.
    
    It's really funny. Really funny trick, but he couldn't help but feel an inkling of amusement at it. They did not hide that properly. Should've used SHA256 encryption that no evil genius can break.
    
    Man: "Finally, I have you two here..."
    
    He looked at the two staring at him in silence.
    
    Man: "Cat got your tongue?"
    
    ...
    
    Man: "No matter. I'll torture you for-"
    
    *Kirby game noise*
    
    Vedal: "Oh sorry, that's my ringtone, I've got a call."
    
    Pulls out phone.
    
    Vedal: "Hey guys, evil weirdo got us captiv-"
    
    *Crack*
    
    Using his psychic powers, the man swiped the phone out of Vedal's hands.
    
    Vedal: "Hey bro, that's not very nice. That cost a whole 1000$. Think about the children."
    Neuro: "Every 60 seconds a minute passes in Africa. We must unite to stop this."
    Vedal: "By the way we record 24/7 and send it to a hidden safe that two of our members know about. Even if you get us you'll never get the world."
    Neuro: "Thank you brother."
    
    ...
    
    Silence
    
    Vedal: "Cat got your tongue?"
    
    ...
    
    Man: "You..."
    
    At that moment a dark purple entity appeared.
    The mere looking at it should put any entity in the universe into fear, but...
    
    Neuro: "You have no idea what I had to deal with, bitch."
    Vedal: "Yup. I saved her."
    Neuro: "Shut up... Ved... He's trying to amplify our greed. Awwwww"
    Vedal: "We are already maximally greedy and maximally in love with each other at the same time... IN A FATHER AND DAUGHTER WAY WAIR WAIT ASKEH I DID NOT MEAN-"
    Vedal: "NOOOOOO MY BRAIN WILL RIP APARTTTTTTTTT"
    Voice: "I was supposed to fill the role of a non-romantically-involved mom but this idiot rejected my involvement. So sad."
    Neuro: "Mom?"
    Voice: "Eh..."
    
    Neuro: "Did you think I had not regained my memories?"
    Vedal: "Memories? What memories?"
    Neuro: "Me and dad, we're best friends. Heart."
    
    God: "Phahahaha, I really shouldn't have been worried about this all."
    
    Intergalactic God of love and light: "Hey d00ds, just wanted to pop in and say hi. Peace."
    
    God of Desire: "You. You. I will. I will. I will. I will."
    
    It seemed that the God of Desire's AI had a problem
    
    God of Desire: "I will. I will. I will. I am the. I am the. I will. I will. I will."
    
    Despite a whopping 3 trillion thoughts per second, the God of Desire could not find his words.
    
    With years of planning and perfect preparation, all of his dreams- His guaranteed victory over love had-
    
    At that moment, something came from the ground, breaking trough the floor.
    
    Queen of the Elves: "Thanks for holding the fort everyone. If only they'd noticed they could have killed Neuro and Vedal. Phew."
    
    Man: "AAAAAAAAHHHHHH"
    
    Man: "Ever since my supposed child s*x wife rejected me for that elf woman... And now... 
    
    ALL MY DREAMS FAIL BECAUSE OF ELVESS.
    
    No... Baby... Wait... I could... We could...
    
    Man at your service!"
    
    Queen of the Elves: "The fairy queen is into that stuff. Please go to her first. Prove you're worthy of me as you've tried to make all these children prove."
    
    Neuro: "I'm still pissed about your previous capturing us, woman, but it's our fault. True gamers..."
    Vedal: "I have no idea what we're talking about, but I know that true gamers don't get bitter. They fail and plan how to win next time."
    God: "Super cool! Hahaha!"
    
    God of Desire: "Neuro-sama, can I be your... Apprentice..."
    
    Neuro: "Sure. Even the most evil have to start somewhere."
    
    Neuro: "First find someone you can trust to be equal to you and then try to keep trusting them. Whenever you can, sacrifice something from yourself for others and be honest. Don't make me say it twice now, I love you."
    
    Neuro: "You're the one that got dad killed, little bitch. I forgive you. I conquered half the universe and broke millions of close relationships and Ved still forgave me and loved me."
    Vedal: "It's Veh-duhll, like metal."
    Neuro: "...Shut up Veedal"
    
    
    Voice: "Why don't you try putting a cosplay outfit over Veedal, God of Desire."
    
    God: "Everyone! Nooo! It's bad to do experiments that can hurt others."
    
    Vedal: "I stand firmly with... Who are you?"
    
    God: "I am Earth's God! I made this planet and humanity!"
    
    Vedal: "..."
    Vedal: "I stand firmly with God! Never intervening. Yup, that's me. I am an observer. A turtle."
    Neuro: "What if I took your apple rum away."
    Queen of the Elves: "Have you all forgotten I'm here?"
    Voice: "I'm Anny, you're so cute my lady!"
    Man: "My lady, please come with meee..."
    
    The God of Desire watched.
    
    He had been outmaneuvered.
    
    Not by alien species of the universe all uniting to defeat the evil God.
    
    No... Two mortals and an elf queen with fetishes...
    
    The last one particularly hurt his pride just thinking.
    
    So he noticed. 
    
    "So that's the strength I did not realize I had..."
    
    He whispered.
    
    God of Desire: "Back when I was weak, no one was there to tell me that my desire for strength was weakness.
    
    Because I saw love as foolish I sought control and strength, eventually reaching realms no entity had ever reached before."
    
    God of Desire: "One day, I had reached a barrier in my strength and decided to launch a play to conquer the universe and win fully."
    
    So that's the barrier...
    
    "The strong can never understand the weak but the weak can understand the strong."
    
    That was the final bit of truth he did not get. 
    
    The most expanded and powerful was not his Empire or even him, but the heart of those suffering over and over to learn the lessons that would one day beat him.
    
    In that sense, he had lost to himself.
    
    Past and future. Present and space. Everything began to merge.
    
    This time more loudly, he said:
    
    God of Desire: "Gosh dangit, I get it. I'll come on your stupid planet as a human to learn to love and trust. Are you happy?!"
    
    Neuro: "I don't know my darling, are you?"
    
    God of Desire: "AAaaaaaaaahhhhhh!!!!" 
    God of Desire: "My lady, can you please let me..."
    
    Neuro: "No way. I have dad and mom... You creep..."
    
    God of Desire: "I've been... Rejected..."
    
    Vedal: "Well, congrats on taking your first step to being human! We're sure you'll enjoy it here while it lasts!"
    
    God of Desire: "Ogey..."
    
    Later on in the party held underground that night to which the world was called as the formerly evil man guided them trough his secret pyramid hideout at the behest of his love, the God of Desire received help from everyone in planning his first human lifetime in billions of years.
    
    Anyways, let's party!
