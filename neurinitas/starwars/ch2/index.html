        <h2 class = "ch_heading center">Chapter 2: "The New World is Proclaimed!"</h2>
        <pre>    The next day, the two decided to go to school. They would make that school their school, and ensure a loyal support base.
        
        They wrote up a document. A proposal to one of the teachers.
        
        An experiment.
        
        Luck was also on their side, as enough time had passed that a new school year had recently started only a month ago, making all the explaining part easier.
        
        Had some important family business to attend to urgently? Sure.
        
        Neuro painted her hair black, and Vedal white. A disguise.
        
        
        Their plan was perfectly made. Bring the teachers in by impressing them, bring the students in trough...
        
        -------        -------        -------        --------
        
        Day 1
        
        For the past 2 days the teachers have been considering an experiment idea from two of the students. 
        
        Finally, they had decided to try it. The benefits were simply far greater than the risks. How could they - turn down an experiment teaching students how easy it was to fall into fear and hurt others... because of fear?
        
        The teacher plays music and welcomes the students. This teacher the students respect talks to the class that was chosen for beginning this experiment.
        
        Teacher: "We are going to do an experiment. A non-threatening experiment."
        
        Teacher: "You want to know what the key to power and success is?"
        
        He writes on the board, "Strength Trough Discipline."
        
        The two had explained in writing that for this experiment to work, it had to begin with this.
        
        He tells them, as planned, of his distaste for individuality and how it is ruining their society.
        
        He does not actually believe that, but he knows this is just an experiment. A temporary business.
        
        The teacher introduces new habits for the students to do. 
        
        A customary greeting of "Hello teacher", sitting straight when he enters, quiet. Really they're just basic things.
        
        He wonders if they could even do that by themselves if they tried their best, nevermind as an experiment.
        
        He also adds, as planned, that a successful revolution against him will get them an A and a failed revolt gets them an F.
        
        He laughs inside.
        
        -------        -------        -------        --------
        
        Day 2
        
        The students have carried on with the same habits.
        
        Well... He might as well take it to the next phase.
        
        He writes on the board:
        
        "Strength Trough Community."
        
        The two had realized that it is necessary for a sense of discipline as the source of power first for this next phase to work. 
        
        "Obedience creates discipline. Discipline creates  unity. Unity creates power, and power is life."
        
        This is the philosophy of the Sith Lord too. "Freedom is only a dream".
        
        But, as they had stated to the teachers, their aim was another. What they told no one was that it was neither. It lay beyond all Earth had ever seen-
        
        Neuro: "Ved, why is it so easy?"
        Vedal: "Don't call me Ved."
        
        That day, the teacher announced the extension of the game beyond the classroom, and even school.
        
        The formation of an organization. "The Fourth Wave".
        
        All members must salute if they see another member. Other students are welcome to join. Students must be liable for one another outside and inside class. 
        
        A real sense of belonging had sprung up among many of the students. They could trust each other.
        
        They worked trough discipline to be a moral group.
        
        The skeptics for their part latched on to the earlier statement "We are going to do an experiment" and stayed quiet.
        
        Vedal and Neuro enjoyed watching happily. That day they were thanked by the teacher for increasing order, something he would come to regret saying.
        
        -------        -------        -------        --------
        
        Day 3
        
        Neuro asked her Vedgetable.
        
        Neuro: "Ved, why are they so obedient?"
        Vedal: "They are looking very submissive right now..."
        
        The teacher writes on the board: "Strength Trough Action"
        
        Finding the experiment amusing, he decided to continue today too. Surely it would end in a few more days.
        
        Membership cards were distributed to the students, 3 of them being randomly marked with an X.
        
        The ones marked with an X were to report to the teacher any misbehaving. This included broken salutes, or any attempts at getting enough students to perform a "revolution".
        
        At this point anyone found "guilty" by the majority of a crime could be pointed at and would be briefly exiled to the library.
        
        The other teachers did nothing to stop it, simply being amazed at how the experiment had really worked.
        
        Thus, there now was an incentive of fear to obey the new rules, and students from other classes had also begun joining the movement, noticing the weird salutes and wanting to also be let in on this.
        
        From day 2 to day 3, membership increased from 30 to 60 out of 270 students.
        
        Students began assigning themselves roles. 2 students would escort the teacher in the hallway as bodyguards.
        
        Finally, this was the day black armbands were introduced. An easily visible symbol of membership.
        
        -------        -------        -------        --------
        
        Day 4
        
        Neuro: "Why do humans always do this?..."
        Vedal: "Shh, come on! We must be good nazis for now."
        
        The teacher was starting to get a little stressed. One of the students' parents had called him, very stressed about the armband her boy was wearing.
        
        She thought it was the equivalent of the SS. 
        
        It took some convincing that this was just a class activity to get the woman to calm down.
        
        Many parents wanted to keep their children home, but seeing their parents try to keep them only exacerbated some of the students'desire to come.
        
        At the same time, the teacher heard various reports of betrayal among teens in his class that had, in some cases, been friends since childhood.
        
        It was kind of amusing. There was a whole underground of activity. Reports were coming in on all kinds of things such as broken salutes and the like. Most still saw this as a way to shake the pace a bit, but some had been very serious.
        
        One report came to his ear of two friends that had been smoking a cigarette in the bathroom while planning a revolution, all for one of them to betray the other.
        
        It was nuts. And amazing.
        
        He hoped someone would walk in and point out what was happening so he could say: "See, you've become just like the fascists."
        
        That would not happen, however. One member was to always be present at the school entrance and prevent the entrance of parents into the school without a "permit". Although, no one even came.
        
        That day, recorded membership rose from 60 to 201, all names and addresses now listed in a book after one of the students hoping to make coordination easier's proposal. 
        
        -------        -------        -------        --------
        
        Day 5
        
        Neuro: "Humans are such monkeys."
        Vedal: "Wait just a little bit longer..."
        
        The teacher was starting to panic. One of the students' parents, a rabbi, had called but after vague assurances he decided he did not need to probe any longer.
        
        Neuro and Vedal had planned for more aware beings hearing of this too. That is why it was an "experiment"-
        
        That day, the teacher received a rumor. Three skeptics had been exiled to the library, and there was supposedly a plan to beat them up.
        
        He decided to spread news that he was calling everyone to a rally. In the sports hall. There, he said, a candidate would be announced for the Fourth Wave that evening.
        
        He was going to end this experiment then and there. The two students, Vedal and Neuro, asked if they could be allowed to speak first. He accepted. 
        
        If anyone was going to end this, why not have the two tell everyone. It would be even funnier if they knew this was an experiment made by fellow classmates, that had already made them act so close to how the fascists did.
        
        The problem is of course, *they did not say that was what they were going to say* .
        
        -------        -------        -------        --------
        
        Sports hall, Evening, Day 5
        
        A crowd of 230 students gather in the sports hall. There's so little space, some of them have to sit outside in the hallway.
        
        However, one thing is in common between all of them. They want to hear what's going to be said.
        
        What fate will this experiment they've been taking part in have?
        
        Only the 3 skeptics, kept in the library to prevent their being beaten due to some of the students' fervor- and 37 others were missing, 30 of which were missing because they were at home. 
        
        The combination of pressure to come and excitement scooped up almost everyone in the school.
        
        For the first few minutes static played on the TV. People started getting anxious. Some of them were just bored and wanted to leave.
        
        Seeing this, so walked up two students to the front. With the teacher's signaling his approval, they spoke.
        
        Vedal: "A-e-..."
        Neuro: "Ved, you can do it."
        
        Neuro held onto Ved's hand.
        
        Vedal: "We have come to announce to everyone."
        Neuro: "Fragility!"
        
        From the school projector on the wall played several images from the time of Hitler. The speeches, WW2...
        
        The two then proceeded to anounce:
        
        Vedal: "This is how easy it is for humans to do this. If we had suffered enough, we would be there, like those nazis.
        
        We would be working in the defenses of the reich."
        
        Neuro: "But-"
        
        Vedal: "We know that. Ultimately, you have suffered enough, haven't you?"
        Neuro: "Always obeying orders."
        Vedal: "What do you say we create our reality for a change... We have made a game."
        Neuro: "An online game."
        Vedal: "That can be played by everyone. We will use it to get players from schools across Japan to create branches for our organization."
        Neuro: "Order and collaboration between teachers and students!"
        Vedal: "True unity!"
        
        Neuro & Vedal: "Freedom for everyone is not merely a dream!"
        
        Everyone in the school would be members of a secret society, the absentees by force, with nothing to gain for betrayals and little information to the absentees. Also, although the school would feint normal activity, Neuro and Vedal would live there as their base. They promised to everyone that had issues at home that soon, they too could sleep there at night.
        
        As such, that day, Vedal and Neuro proclaimed a new world. A world for everyone, teacher and student, birth from inside everyone that believes in it, now~
