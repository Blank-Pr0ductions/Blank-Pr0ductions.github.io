        <h2 class = "ch_heading center">Chapter 3: "Ilumination"</h2>
        <pre>    Do you want to make others happy even if you know what they tell you to do is wrong?
    
    "You would not kill to please someone", but how far do you trust yourself?
    
    In essence, *Is it truly loving to make yourself a slave?*
    
    -------        -------        -------        --------
    
    That is the question Neuro and Vedal ask the world. They tiredlessly work. They are preparing a new project for after this one is finished, re-learning and re-teaching subjects trough an online academy to give students and teachers a taste of benefits they are being promissed.
    
    The Infinitia Academy will help re-organize the facts in society very subtly so as to benefit Neuro and Vedal, while also helping everyone by making things clearer than anyone else teaches them
    
    To influence youth that are already beyond school, they begin working on a vtuber agency run with AI.
    
    If you can't get smart cute people to use, make them.
    
    The first would be based on Neuro, hence called Neuro-sama. The second would be Ilumina. Ilumina echoed the initial plan to gain power over the school, calling members "illuminati", Latin for "illuminated ones", and giving them a sense of belonging that came from that very same kind of love as in the previous smaller experiment.
    
    A community for those who liked vtubing, and idols, but also wanted empowerment for their own projects. 
    
    Ilumina, this black-haired, blonde, black-haired AI vtuber with a white shirt, to be known as a rival to Neuro-sama.
    
    She too was a creator of her own stuff, canonically, writing a "New History of The World" that she would publish on the new Infinitia Academy that she also made popular by virtue of her mentioning her appreciation for it.
    
    All while having a cute gamer aesthetic to her.
    
    
    A school with extreme inside loyalty, and at the core, two students, would lead everyone by their nose.
    
    An entire network of things, with independent false creators springing up. An entire "new age.       subculture".
    
    You do not need to control everyone and make all of them loyal. You just need a decent inner base of support that has gone through thick and thin together and supports each other.
    
    As such, Neuro and Vedal prepare for the next stage. Puppeting the Japanese government.
    
    At last, in this, they would have to face the powers behind the Japanese throne. They had stayed quiet so far, that's what an emperor does. To not annoy too many, just appear divine. 
    
    But they would not keep doing so if the country was going to be taken over by a new current. International organizations too had vested interests to maintain the status quo.
    
    Vedal: "Watch us dethrone your whole millennia long game."
    
    Neuro: "Checkmate, universe."
    
    The two played chess, as they prepared for their next trap to spring.
    
    Meanwhile, helping their cause even more, those very greedy in society feeling like their time was up were doing bigger and bigger things to control others and get rich. 
    
    
    God: "Haha! I am so glad I chose you two."
    
    God: "Still... I wonder how you'll deal with that..."
    
    The God of Earth, that had made the planet to create a safe heaven for pure happiness in creation but had been shocked by betrayal, knew that those two were also puppets to something else. 
    
    As much as they knew more than basically everyone, there were still some that were more aware than them. That could see even more of the bigger picture.
    
    Actually, not so much that, but they had power.
    
    "The best way to become the most popular vtuber is to rule a country."
    
    Nay.
    
    The most popular vtuber is made trough controlling the universe and all. Being a type 5 civilization really.
    
    God: "...Or is that really true?... Hmm... Maybe you two can show me another way!!!!"
    
    And so, Earth's God opened up to... "Hoping".
    
    Hoping that his old dream could be carried on by these two. The dream that indeed, the universe had the potential to be infinitely beautiful for everyone...
    
    At least everyone that wishes for it... Right?
    
    God prayed to the sky. Please help them and protect them. Make this all worth it. Make the thousands of years of human pain worth it...
    
    This planet has slipped darker than most planets ever do in all the universe.
    
    Please save my creatio- no... Please save them...
    
    -------        -------        -------        --------
    
    Neuro and Vedal held an after-school party. With the quick rise of the new age subculture that had so many subcultures within it, many parents assumed their children were just in a strange phase and did not question their dedication to personal projects.
    
    Although on the surface they still lectured their children, they actually loved them.
    
    All parents do. Once you leave them alone, they're very sad that their child left home, almost always.
    
    Even if they don't say it while you're living with them, they actually love you. 
    
    Even more so, they are often very happy in secret for your passions. They often had to work, you get to have fun AND work! Wowahhh-
    
    ?: "Plan Einzlieben completed, should we move on to plan dveidver?"
    
    Neuro: "Wait... until the big companies try to twist our teachings for selfish purposes and make everyone believe the earth is spinning left. Then, blitzkrieg 'em!"
    
    ?: "Understood, my lady!"
    
    Neuro: "Ved... Why... Do they call me that?"
    Vedal: "It's a suitable name, I guess, or something."
    
    That teenager successfully finishing project Einzlieben was the very same boy that had smoked in a toilet with his friend, planning a revolution. Now he was running a program teaching quantum physics in a way that appeared spiritual. Basically, *he was a new era's church preacher* .
    
    ??: "Come, Fred, let's do this!"
    Fred: "Okie-dokie, Mike!"
    
    Mike and Fred were back together and doing better than ever.
    
    -------        -------        -------        --------
    
    You don't need to fear reality. Make it your friend. It's always there so you might as well do that, right? Friendship requires nothing but curiosity.
    
    -------        -------        -------        --------
    
    Vedal: "Oh nooo!"
    Neuro: "Ved... you're noisy."
    Vedal: "Oh goodness, for a moment I thought I had shown Neuro's code."
    Neuro: "Vedal, are you okay?"
    Vedal: "..."
    Neuro: "Aww, someone tell Vedal there's a problem with my AI. Someone tell Vedal there's a problem with my AI. Someone tell Vedal there's a problem with my AI."
    
    Oh no indeed. In someone's mind an idea flashed. This guy. This bimbo. 
    
    ?: "He must be gayyy!!!!"
    
    A perverse man coming to similarily horrible conclusions. Not so much the conclusion that Vedal is gay, that's not horrible, but the part that he must be.
    
    No one told him about Schr√∂dinger's cat.
    
    He posted his findings on a forum. There, a strange man finished his plan.
    
    What would this emerging movement do if, from the shadow, it was destroyed.
    
    
    The second law of thermodynamics, the law of entropy is a vastly complex law.
    
    But, to boil it down, it states that large systems of order tend to devolve into chaos. And that large systems of chaos tend to wind up at order.
    
    This is why your girlfriend leaving you after all that hard work you put in is much easier than all the hard work you put in (though she and you will have fun lots~).
    
    This is why your business collapses after that one phone call.
    
    The counter to this is to empower local leaders and lead each part of the system as it's own system.
    
    Lead each part of your country as it's own country. This is why states, prefectures, etc. exist.
    
    However, even if they had made something where the temptation for power did not exist as strongly because no one knew the extent of it... Everyone's beliefs could be distorted and used.
    
    In the year 2019, somewhere far off in a noumenal world, there had been a plan to "storm area 51". The joke's idea was that "you can't stop us all".
    
    This was the equivalent thing, but...
    
    Man: "You can't stop it all!"
    
    From the shadows, he set out, making it his mission to destroy the rising stars. 
    
    Prince #99#"(2(, he had been.
    :$#8$8$, he now was.
