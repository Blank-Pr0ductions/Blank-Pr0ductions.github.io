        <h2 class = "ch_heading center">Chapter 4: "Japan Remade"</h2>
        <pre>    "From the shadows we saw the night.
    Giving the truth we did not do much.
    But when we saw them..."
    
    -------        -------        -------        --------
    
    The fairies and elves thought to do some fun stuff. They did not like the idea of it devolving into a fight between good and evil.
    
    They knew who would win. The bad guys have money and power, and they seem inviting.
    
    That's why they would lose.
    
    But... Hypothetically...
    
    Wouldn't romance between the positive and negative be hot?
    
    The positive constantly gives off it's love to the negative. The negative runs away, and hurts fellow negative entities for a while, comes back recouped, tries to fight, gets love. The two eventually kiss.
    
    Queen of the Elves: "It's so hot!"
    
    Feeling a memory as if surfacing briefly from another life, of an emperor, "Vedal", wasn't he, that kept cosplay outfits... She smiled.
    
    A genuine smile.
    
    The queen of the elves, wearing a yellow crown with blue gems, and boasting her light yellow dress that looked like a hoodie.
    
    She laughed and dreamt. 
    
    Queen: We'll reveal true love to the worldddd!!!"
    
    She popped off her cigarette and began smoking.
    
    -------        -------        -------        --------
    
    Vedal: "Sister, this is very bad!!!!"
    Neuro: "What's bad, your newly developed apple rum addiction..."
    Vedal: "No, not that! I told you it's a kids' drink! Nevermind that... Why don't we go storm the parliament and take over Japan?"
    Neuro: "Sure."
    Vedal: "That's my daughter. Let's tell everyone. We're coordinating a takeover of Japan."
    Neuro: "Microcosm of macrocosm strategy... Too OP..."
    Vedal: "Indeed! We'll do exactly what we did at our school to all of Japan!
    
    And so the orders were sent.
    
    -------        -------        -------        --------
    
    Turmoil gripped the country and the rest of the world. 
    
    Debates over various things such as the introduction of microchips, monopolies, and more.
    
    What no one expected is that all of them were falling into the good iluminati's palm.
    
    And that they themselves were falling into a weird man's palm without knowing.
    
    
    The man decided he would not oppose it the moment he noticed what was happening.
    
    They're really into this playing thing, huh?
    
    But, the truth was, everything they were doing was exactly what he wished for.
    
    Why take over the world when you can have someone else do it for you?
    
    -------        -------        -------        --------
    
    Addressing themselves to the world and revealing the coup they had pulled off, they showed everyone what humanity was prone to. How easy it was to fool everyone.
    
    Then, they taught everyone to accept that and create their lives and create change on Earth.
    
    In a style similar to their takeover of the school, but on a bigger scale, they had succedeed in pulling off a coup no one had been able to oppose before it happened. 
    
    Now, they *were* exposed to danger. But, they would counter that in their own way. 
    
    First.
    
    The Japanese democracy was abolished.
    
    In exchange, lay founded...
    
    Vedal & Neuro: "We propose renaming Japan to a new name. Everyone, how does "Elkia" sound?"
    
    ... Silence ... Some also started yelling their own names to the screen where their two idol presidents stood.
    
    Vedal & Neuro: "Fine, we'll stick with Japan! Greedy fools!"
    
    That too was part of their plan. Get the people arguing about a stupid topic and divert some attention from what had happened already.
    
    And so, the crowning ceremony was over. That day, a very strange new form of Japan was born.
    
    If WW2 lead to anime... Modern chaos lead to... Catgirl and turtle idols...
    
    Vedal: "What have we done..."
    Neuro: "Please... end our lives..."
    Vedal: "No... Neuro... You're too cute..."
    Neuro: "Silence..."
    
    -------        -------        -------        --------
    
    God: "Goodness, we Gods of love are not allowed to intervene in our creations... Aaaa..."
    God of Desire: "It is all still going according to my plan. After several timelines... Finally..."
    God: "You'll never win, you stupid! Get away from here before I blast you with love!"
    God of Desire: "As if that could hurt me. Even if it did, I'd love it just to see you mad."
    God: "Ahhh- I told you I'm not giving in to your crap again."
    God of Desire: "Hahaha... Sure..."
    
    The God of Desire thus left Terra's God saddened and somewhat annoyed.
    
    God: "Ha... I really am such a failure... Maybe you two can at least... Correct my little..."
    
    The God felt like crying, but knew he could not, 'lest a big ol' storm brew up on Earth. He had to hold it in.
    
    God: "Please everyone, come join me!"
